            <h2>Development Experience</h2>
            <p>Building this website was not a bad experience there was a lot of different styles being used along with a bit of Java Script for the burger menu. The development experience was important for me because it helped me develop my problem solving skills</p>

            <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
            <p>I chose more of a minimalistic approach to my website and didn't go all out. I started with the colour orange on most of my words in the main page and decided to switch to a RGB colour to make things look nicer as the header. At the bottom of the website I decided to put my name there so people that enter the website will know who's portfolio this is. I decided to use a GIF as the background image to make the website a bit more entertaining for the eye and not too bland while still keeping that minimalistic approach to it.

For the mobile version there is a simple burger menu that uses java script to toggle on and off and this way the user can click on the different pages.</p>
